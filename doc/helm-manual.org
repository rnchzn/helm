* Helm Generic Help

** Basics

# To navigate in this Help buffer see [[Helm help][here]].

Helm narrows down the list of candidates as you type a filter
pattern.  See [[Matching in Helm][Matching in Helm]].

Helm accepts multiple space-separated patterns, each pattern can
be negated with =!=.

Helm also supports fuzzy matching in some places when specified, you
will find several variables to enable fuzzy matching in diverse [[Helm
sources][sources]].

Helm generally uses familiar Emacs keys to navigate the list.
Here follow some of the less obvious bindings:

- {{{kbd(RET)}}} selects the
  candidate from the list, executes the default action upon exiting
  the Helm session.

- {{{kbd(C-j)}}} executes the
  default action but without exiting the Helm session.  Not all
  sources support this.

- {{{kbd(TAB)}}} displays a list of actions
  available on current candidate or all marked candidates.  The
  default binding <tab> is ordinarily used for completion, but that
  would be redundant since Helm completes upon every character
  entered in the prompt.

*Note*: In addition to the default actions list, additional actions
appear depending on the type of the selected candidate(s).  They
are called filtered actions.

- Helm Completion vs Emacs Completion :: https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki#helm-completion-vs-emacs-completion

** Helm sources

Helm uses what’s called sources to provide different kinds of
completions.  Each Helm session can handle one or more source.  A
source is an alist object which is build from various classes, see
[[Writing your own Helm sources][here]].

*Additional Readings*:

- Creating a Helm source :: https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki/Developing#creating-a-source

*** Configure sources

You will find in Helm sources already built and bound to a
variable called generally ~helm-source-<something>~.  In this case
it is an alist and you can change the attributes (keys) values
using ~helm-set-attr~ function in your configuration.  Of course
you have to ensure before calling ~helm-set-attr~ that the file
containing source is loaded, e.g. with ~with-eval-after-load~.  Of
course you can also completely redefine the source but this is
generally not elegant as it duplicate for its most part code
already defined in Helm.

You will find also sources that are not built and even not bound
to any variables because they are rebuilded at each start of a
Helm session.  In this case you can add a defmethod called
~helm-setup-user-source~ to your config:

#+begin_src elisp
    (cl-defmethod helm-setup-user-source ((source helm-moccur-class))
      (setf (slot-value source ’follow) -1))
#+end_src

- Complex Examples Of Configuration :: https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/emacs-tv-config/blob/master/init-helm.el#L340

** Modify keybindings in Helm

Helm main keymap is ~helm-map~, all keys bound in this map apply
to all Helm sources.  However, most sources have their own keymap,
with each binding overriding its counterpart in ~helm-map~, you
can see all bindings in effect in the [[Commands][Commands]]
section (available only if the source has its own keymap and
documentation of course).

** Matching in Helm

All that you write in minibuffer is interpreted as a regexp or
multiple regexps if separated by a space.  This is true for most
sources unless the developer of the source has disabled it or
have choosen to use fuzzy matching.  Even if a source has fuzzy
matching enabled, Helm will switch to multi match as soon as it
detects a space in the pattern.  It may also switch to multi match
as well if pattern starts with a =^= beginning of line sign.  In
those cases each pattern separated with space should be a regexp
and not a fuzzy pattern.  When using multi match patterns, each
pattern starting with =!= is interpreted as a negation i.e.
match everything but this.

*** Completion-styles

Helm generally fetches its candidates with the ~:candidates~
function up to ~helm-candidate-number-limit~ and then applies
match functions to these candidates according to ~helm-pattern~.
But Helm allows matching candidates directly from the ~:candidates~
function using its own ~completion-styles~.
Helm provides ’helm completion style but also ’helm-flex
completion style for Emacs<27 that don’t have ’flex completion
style, otherwise (emacs-27) ’flex completion style is used to
provide fuzzy aka flex completion.
By default, like in Emacs vanilla, all completion commands (e.g.,
~completion-at-point~) using ~completion-in-region~ or
~completing-read~ use ~completion-styles~.
Some Helm native commands like ~helm-M-x~ do use
~completion-styles~.  Any Helm sources can use ~completion-styles~
by using ~:match-dynamic~ slot and building their ~:candidates~
function with ~helm-dynamic-completion~.

Example:

#+begin_src elisp
  (helm :sources (helm-build-sync-source "test"
		   :candidates (helm-dynamic-completion
				’(foo bar baz foab)
				’symbolp)
		   :match-dynamic t)
	:buffer "*helm test*")

#+end_src

By default Helm sets up ~completion-styles~ and always adds ’helm
to it.  However the flex completion styles are not added.  This is
up to the user if she wants to have such completion to enable
this.
As specified above use ’flex for emacs-27 and ’helm-flex for
emacs-26. Anyway, ’helm-flex is not provided in
~completion-styles-alist~ if ’flex is present.

Finally Helm provides two user variables to control
~completion-styles~ usage: ~helm-completion-style~ and
~helm-completion-syles-alist~.  Both variables are customizable.
The former allows retrieving previous Helm behavior if needed, by
setting it to ~helm~ or ~helm-fuzzy~, default being ~emacs~ which
allows dynamic completion and usage of ~completion-styles~.  The
second allows setting ~helm-completion-style~ per mode and also
specifying ~completion-styles~ per mode (see its docstring).  Note
that these two variables take effect only in helm-mode i.e. in
all that uses ~completion-read~ or ~completion-in-region~, IOW all
helmized commands.  File completion in ~read-file-name~ family
doesn’t obey completion-styles and has its own file completion
implementation. Native Helm commands using ~completion-styles~
doesn’t obey ~helm-completion-style~ and
~helm-completion-syles-alist~ (e.g., ~helm-M-x~).

Also for a better control of styles in native Helm sources (not
helmized by helm-mode) using ~:match-dynamic~,
~helm-dynamic-completion~ provides a STYLES argument that allows
specifying explicitely styles for this source.

*Note*: Some old completion styles are not working fine with Helm
and are disabled by default in
~helm-blacklist-completion-styles~.  They are anyway not useful in
Helm because ’helm style supersedes these styles.

** Helm mode

~helm-mode~ toggles Helm completion in native Emacs functions, so
when you turn ~helm-mode~ on, commands like ~switch-to-buffer~
will use Helm completion instead of the usual Emacs completion
buffer.

*** What gets or does not get =helmized= when ~helm-mode~ is enabled?

Helm provides generic completion on all Emacs functions using
~completing-read~, ~completion-in-region~ and their derivatives,
e.g. ~read-file-name~.  Helm exposes a user variable to control
which function to use for a specific Emacs command:
~helm-completing-read-handlers-alist~.  If the function for a
specific command is nil, it turns off Helm completion.  See the
variable documentation for more infos.

*** Helm functions vs helmized Emacs functions

While there are Helm functions that perform the same completion
as other helmized Emacs functions, e.g. ~switch-to-buffer~ and
~helm-buffers-list~, the native Helm functions like
~helm-buffers-list~ can receive new features that allow marking
candidates, have several actions, etc.  Whereas the helmized Emacs
functions only have Helm completion, Emacs can provide no more
than one action for this function.  This is the intended behavior.

Generally you are better off using the native Helm command than
the helmized Emacs equivalent.

*** Completion behavior with Helm and completion-at-point

Helm is NOT completing dynamically.  That means that when you are
completing some text at point, completion is done against this
text and subsequent characters you add AFTER this text.  This
allows you to use matching methods provided by Helm, that is multi
matching or fuzzy matching (see [[Matching in Helm][Matching in
Helm]]).

Completion is not done dynamically (against ~helm-pattern~)
because backend functions (i.e. ~competion-at-point-functions~)
are not aware of Helm matching methods.

By behaving like this, the benefit is that you can fully use Helm
matching methods but you can’t start a full completion against a
prefix different than the initial text you have at point.  Helm
warns you against this by colorizing the initial input and sends
a user-error message when trying to delete backward text beyond
this limit at first hit on DEL.  A second hit on DEL within a
short delay (1s) quits Helm and delete-backward char in
current-buffer.

** Helm help

{{{kbd(C-x c h h)}}}: Show all Helm documentations concatenated
in one org file.

From a Helm session, just hit {{{kbd(C-h m)}}} to have
the documentation for the current source followed by the global
Helm documentation.

While in the help buffer, most of the Emacs regular key bindings
are available; the most important ones are shown in minibuffer.
However, due to implementation restrictions, no regular Emacs
keymap is used (it runs in a loop when reading the help buffer).
Only simple bindings are available and they are defined in
~helm-help-hkmap~, which is a simple alist of (key . function).
You can define or redefine bindings in help with
~helm-help-define-key~ or by adding/removing entries directly in

** Customize Helm

Helm provides a lot of user variables for extensive customization.
From any Helm session, type {{{kbd(C-h c)}}}
to jump to the current source ~custom~ group.  Helm also has a
special group for faces you can access via {{{kbd(M-x customize-group RET helm-faces)}}}.

*Note*: Some sources may not have their group set and default to
the ~helm~ group.

** Display Helm in windows and frames

You can display the Helm completion buffer in many different
window configurations, see the custom interface to discover the
different windows configurations available (See [[Customize Helm][Customize Helm]] to jump to custom interface).
When using Emacs in a graphic display (i.e. not in a terminal) you can as
well display your Helm buffers in separated frames globally for
all Helm commands or separately for specific Helm commands.
See ~helm-display-function~ and ~helm-commands-using-frame~.

There is a variable to allow reusing frame instead of deleting
and creating a new one at each session, see ~helm-display-buffer-reuse-frame~.
Normally you don’t have to use this, it have been made to workaround
slow frame popup in Emacs-26, to workaround this slowness in Emacs-26 use instead

#+begin_src elisp
    (when (= emacs-major-version 26)
      (setq x-wait-for-event-timeout nil))
#+end_src

*Warning*:
There is a package called posframe and also one called helm-posframe,
you DO NOT need these packages to display helm buffers in frames.

| C-j         |                  | Persistent action (Execute and keep Helm session)                    |

*Note*: Any of these bindings are from ~helm-map~ and may be
overriten by the map specific to the current source in use (each
source can have its own keymap).

** The actions menu

You can display the action menu in the same window
as helm candidates (default) or in a side window according to
~helm-show-action-window-other-window~ value.

When the action menu popup, the helm prompt is used to narrow
down this menu, no more candidates.

When ~helm-allow-mouse~ is non nil, you can use as well
mouse-3 (right click) in the candidate zone to select actions
with the mouse once your candidate is selected.

** Action transformers

You may be surprized to see your actions list changing depending
on the context.  This happen when a source has an action
transformer function which checks the current selected candidate
and adds specific actions for this candidate.

** Shortcuts for n-th first actions

{{{kbd(<f1>)}}}...{{{kbd(<f12>)}}}: Execute n-th action where n is 1 to 12.

** Shortcuts for executing the default action on the n-th candidate

Helm does not display line numbers by default, with Emacs-26+ you
can enable it permanently in all helm buffers with:

    #+begin_src elisp
      (add-hook ’helm-after-initialize-hook ’helm-init-relative-display-line-numbers)
    #+end_src

You can also toggle line numbers with
{{{kbd(C-c l)}}} in current Helm
buffer.

Of course when enabling ~global-display-line-numbers-mode~ Helm
buffers will have line numbers as well. (Don’t forget to
customize ~display-line-numbers-type~ to relative).

In Emacs versions < to 26 you will have to use linum-relative[fn:3]
package and ~helm-linum-relative-mode~.

Then when line numbers are enabled with one of the methods above
the following keys are available[fn:4]:

{{{kbd(C-x <n>)}}}: Execute default action on the n-th candidate before
currently selected candidate.

{{{kbd(C-c <n>)}}}: Execute default action on the n-th candidate after
current selected candidate.

=n= is limited to 1-9.  For larger jumps use other navigation
keys.

** Mouse control in Helm

A basic support for the mouse is provided when the user sets
~helm-allow-mouse~ to non-nil.

- mouse-1 selects the candidate.
- mouse-2 executes the default action on selected candidate.
- mouse-3 pops up the action menu.

*Note*: When mouse control is enabled in Helm, it also lets you
click around and lose the minibuffer focus: you’ll have to click
on the Helm buffer or the minibuffer to retrieve control of your
Helm session.

** Marked candidates

You can mark candidates to execute an action on all of them
instead of the current selected candidate only.  (See bindings
below.) Most Helm actions operate on marked candidates unless
candidate-marking is explicitely forbidden for a specific source.

- To mark/unmark a candidate, use
  {{{kbd(C-@)}}}.  (See bindings below.) With a
  numeric prefix arg mark ARG candidates forward, if ARG is
  negative mark ARG candidates backward.

- To mark all visible unmarked candidates at once in current
  source use {{{kbd(M-a)}}}.  With a prefix argument, mark all
  candidates in all sources.

- To unmark all visible marked candidates at once use
  {{{kbd(M-U)}}}.

- To mark/unmark all candidates at once use
  {{{kbd(M-m)}}}.  With a prefix argument, mark/unmark
  all candidates in all sources.

*Note*: When multiple candidates are selected across different
sources, only the candidates of the current source will be used
when executing most actions (as different sources can have
different actions).  Some actions support multi-source marking
however.

** Follow candidates

When ~helm-follow-mode~ is on ({{{kbd(C-c C-f)}}}
to toggle it), moving up and down Helm session or updating the
list of candidates will automatically execute the
persistent-action as specified for the current source.

If ~helm-follow-mode-persistent~ is non-nil, the state of the
mode will be restored for the following Helm sessions.

If you just want to follow candidates occasionally without
enabling ~helm-follow-mode~, you can use
{{{kbd(C-<down>)}}} or
{{{kbd(C-<up>)}}} instead.  Conversely, when
~helm-follow-mode~ is enabled, those commands go to previous/next
line without executing the persistent action.

** Frequently Used Commands

| Keys     | Description                                                                       |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-t      | Toggle vertical/horizontal split on first hit and swap Helm window on second hit. |
| C-c %    | Exchange minibuffer and header-line.                                              |
| C-x C-f  | Drop into ‘helm-find-files’.                                                      |
| C-c C-k  | Kill display value of candidate and quit (with prefix arg, kill the real value).  |
| C-c C-y  | Yank current selection into pattern.                                              |
| C-c TAB  | Copy selected candidate at point in current buffer.                               |
| C-c C-f  | Toggle automatic execution of persistent action.                                  |
| C-<down> | Run persistent action then select next line.                                      |
| C-<up>   | Run persistent action then select previous line.                                  |
| C-c C-u  | Recalculate and redisplay candidates.                                             |
| C-!      | Toggle candidate updates.                                                         |

** Special yes, no or yes for all answers

You may be prompted in the minibuffer to answer by [y,n,!,q] in
some places for confirmation.

- y  mean yes
- no mean no
- !  mean yes for all
- q  mean quit or abort current operation.

When using ! you will not be prompted for the same thing in
current operation any more, e.g. file deletion, file copy etc...

** Moving in ~helm-buffer~

You can move in ~helm-buffer~ with the usual commands used in
Emacs: ({{{kbd(C-n)}}},
{{{kbd(C-p)}}}, etc.  See above basic
commands.  When ~helm-buffer~ contains more than one source,
change source with {{{kbd(C-o)}}} and
{{{kbd(M-o)}}}.

*Note*: When reaching the end of a source,
{{{kbd(C-n)}}} will *not* go to the next source
when variable ~helm-move-to-line-cycle-in-source~ is non-nil, so
you will have to use {{{kbd(C-o)}}} and
{{{kbd(M-o)}}}.

** Resume previous session from current Helm session

You can use {{{kbd(C-c n)}}} (~helm-run-cycle-resume~) to cycle in
resumables sources.  {{{kbd(C-c n)}}} is a special key set with
~helm-define-key-with-subkeys~ which, after pressing it, allows
you to keep cycling with further {{{kbd(n)}}}.

*Tip*: You can bound the same key in ~global-map~ to
     ~helm-cycle-resume~ with ~helm-define-key-with-subkeys~ to
     let you transparently cycle sessions, Helm fired up or not.
     You can also bind the cycling commands to single key
     presses (e.g., {{{kbd(S-<f1>)}}}) this time with a simple
     ~define-key~.  (Note that {{{kbd(S-<f1>)}}} is not available in
     terminals.)

*Note*: ~helm-define-key-with-subkeys~ is available only once Helm
is loaded.

You can also use
{{{kbd(C-x b)}}} to resume
the previous session, or
{{{kbd(C-x C-b)}}} to have
completion on all resumable buffers.

** Global commands

*** Resume Helm session from outside Helm

{{{kbd(C-x c b)}}} revives the last Helm session.
Binding a key to this command will greatly improve Helm
interactivity, e.g. when quitting Helm accidentally.

You can call {{{kbd(C-x c b)}}} with a prefix argument
to choose (with completion!) which session you’d like to resume.
You can also cycle in these sources with ~helm-cycle-resume~ (see
above).

** Debugging Helm

Helm exposes the special variable ~helm-debug~: setting it to
non-nil will enable Helm logging in a special outline-mode
buffer.  Helm resets the variable to nil at the end of each
session.

For convenience, {{{kbd(C-h C-d)}}}
allows you to turn on debugging for this session only.  To avoid
accumulating log entries while you are typing patterns, you can
use {{{kbd(C-!)}}} to turn off
updating.  When you are ready turn it on again to resume logging.

Once you exit your Helm session you can access the debug buffer
with ~helm-debug-open-last-log~.  It is possible to save logs to
dated files when ~helm-debug-root-directory~ is set to a valid
directory.

*Note*: Be aware that Helm log buffers grow really fast, so use
~helm-debug~ only when needed.

** Writing your own Helm sources

Writing simple sources for your own usage is easy.  When calling
the ~helm~ function, the sources are added the ~:sources~ slot
which can be a symbol or a list of sources.  Sources can be built
with different EIEIO classes depending on what you want to do.  To
simplify this, several ~helm-build-*~ macros are provided.  Below
there are simple examples to start with.

#+begin_src elisp
    ;; Candidates are stored in a list.
    (helm :sources (helm-build-sync-source "test"
		     ;; A function can be used as well
		     ;; to provide candidates.
		     :candidates ’("foo" "bar" "baz"))
	  :buffer "*helm test*")

    ;; Candidates are stored in a buffer.
    ;; Generally faster but doesn’t allow a dynamic updating
    ;; of the candidates list i.e the list is fixed on start.
    (helm :sources (helm-build-in-buffer-source "test"
		     :data ’("foo" "bar" "baz"))
	  :buffer "*helm test*")
#+end_src

* Helm Buffer

** Pattern matching in helm-buffers

You can filter the buffer list based on one or more of the following
components:

1. buffer's ~mode-name~
2. its content
3. its directory
4. its name

A buffer match pattern is a space-separated list of one or more
directives.  Each directive looks like

: <pattern-type><negate-may-be><pattern-value>

=<pattern-type>= determines how the =<pattern-value>= is
interpreted. =<pattern-type>= can be one of the following:

- =*= :: Partially match =<pattern-value>= against buffer's ~mode-name~
- =@= :: Partially match =<pattern-value>= against buffer's contents
- =/= :: Partially match =<pattern-value>= against buffer's directory
- =^= :: Fuzz-matching.  The description of what the pattern does is
  not clear.
- {{{samp({{{unicode(200b)}}})}}} :: an empty string.  Compare =<pattern-value>=
    against buffer's name.

=<negate-may-be>= determines the truth value of the match.  It can be
one of the following:

- {{{samp({{{unicode(200b)}}})}}} :: an empty string.  =<pattern-value>= must
  partially match the corresponding attribute

- =!= ::  Negate the sense of above match.

*** Examples
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

Down below you see some common patterns, and how they are interpreted:

- Match against buffer's ~mode-name~

  - =*lisp= :: List only buffers whose ~mode-name~ name matches =lisp=.

  - =*!lisp= :: List only buffers whose ~mode-name~ name does /not/ match
    =lisp=.

  - =*!lisp,!sh,!fun= :: List only buffers whose mode name does /not/
    match any of =lisp=, =sh= or =fun=.

- Match against buffer's content

  - =@foo= :: List only those  buffers that contain =foo=

  - =@!foo= :: List only those buffers that do /not/ contain =foo=.

  - =@foo @bar= :: List only those buffers that contain both =foo= /and/
    =bar=.

  - =@foo @!bar= :: List only those buffers that contain =foo= but /not/
    =bar=.

- Match against buffer's directory

  - =/src=  :: List only buffers whose directory matches =src=.

- Match against buffer's name in a fuzzy way

- Match against a combination of above criterion.

  - =*lisp ^helm @moc= :: List only buffers that are in =lisp= mode, whose
    name starts start with =helm= and contains =moc=.

  - =*lisp ^helm moc= :: List only buffers that are in =lisp= mode, whose
    name starts start with =helm= and whose name contains =moc=

  - =*!lisp !helm= :: List only buffers that are NOT in =lisp= mode and
    whose name does NOT match =helm=.

  - =/helm/ w3= ::  List only buffers whose directory matches =helm= and
    whose name matches =w3=.

** Tips

*** COMMENT Completion

**** Major-mode

You can enter a partial major-mode name (e.g. lisp, sh) to narrow down buffers.
To specify the major-mode, prefix it with =*= e.g. =*lisp=.

If you want to match all buffers but the ones with a specific major-mode
(negation), prefix the major-mode with =!= e.g. =*!lisp=.

If you want to specify more than one major-mode, separate them with =,=,
e.g. =*!lisp,!sh,!fun= lists all buffers but the ones in lisp-mode, sh-mode
and fundamental-mode.

Then enter a space followed by a pattern to narrow down to buffers matching this
pattern.

**** Search inside buffers

If you enter a space and a pattern prefixed by =@=, Helm searches for text
matching this pattern *inside* the buffer (i.e. not in the name of the buffer).

Negation are supported i.e. =!=.

When you specify more than one of such patterns, it will match
buffers with contents matching each of these patterns i.e. AND,
not OR.  That means that if you specify =@foo @bar= the contents
of buffer will have to be matched by foo AND bar.  If you specify
=@foo @!bar= it means the contents of the buffer have to be
matched by foo but NOT bar.

If you enter a pattern prefixed with an escaped =@=, Helm searches for a
buffer matching =@pattern= but does not search inside the buffer.

**** Search by directory name

If you prefix the pattern with =/=, Helm matches over the directory names
of the buffers.

This feature can be used to narrow down the search to one directory while
subsequent strings entered after a space match over the buffer name only.

Note that negation is not supported for matching on buffer filename.

Starting from Helm v1.6.8, you can specify more than one directory.

**** Fuzzy matching

~helm-buffers-fuzzy-matching~ turns on fuzzy matching on buffer names, but not
on directory names or major modes.  A pattern starting with =^= disables fuzzy
matching and matches by exact regexp.

**** Examples

With the following pattern

    : *lisp ^helm @moc

Helm narrows down the list by selecting only the buffers that are in lisp mode,
start with =helm= and which content matches =moc=.

Without the =@=

    : *lisp ^helm moc

Helm looks for lisp mode buffers starting with =helm= and containing =moc=
in their name.

With this other pattern

    : *!lisp !helm

Helm narrows down to buffers that are not in =lisp= mode and that do not match
=helm=.

With this last pattern

    : /helm/ w3

Helm narrows down to buffers that are in any =helm= subdirectory and
matching =w3=.

*** Creating buffers
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

When creating a new buffer, use {{{kbd(C-u)}}} to choose a mode from a
list.  This list is customizable, see ~helm-buffers-favorite-modes~.

*** Killing buffers
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

You can kill buffers either one by one or all the marked buffers at once.

One kill-buffer command leaves Helm while the other is persistent.  Run the
persistent kill-buffer command either with the regular
~helm-execute-persistent-action~ called with a prefix argument ({{{kbd(C-u C-j)}}})
or with its specific command ~helm-buffer-run-kill-persistent~.  See the
bindings below.

*** Switching to buffers
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

To switch to a buffer, press RET, to switch to a buffer in another window, select this buffer
and press {{{kbd(C-c o)}}}, when called with a prefix arg
the buffer will be displayed vertically in other window.
If you mark more than one buffer, the marked buffers will be displayed in different windows.

*** Saving buffers
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

If buffer is associated to a file and is modified, it is by default colorized in orange,
see [[Meaning of colors and prefixes for buffers][Meaning of colors and prefixes for buffers]].
You can save these buffers with {{{kbd(C-x C-s)}}}.
If you want to save all these buffers, you can mark them with {{{kbd(C-M-SPC)}}}
and save them with {{{kbd(C-x C-s)}}}.  You can also do this in one step with
{{{kbd(C-x s)}}}.  Note that you will not be asked for confirmation.

*** Meaning of colors and prefixes for buffers
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

Remote buffers are prefixed with ’@’.

- Red         ::  Buffer’s file was modified on disk by an external process.
- Indianred2  ::  Buffer exists but its file has been deleted.
- Orange      ::  Buffer is modified and not saved to disk.
- Italic      ::  A non-file buffer.
- Yellow      ::  Tramp archive buffer.

* Helm Find Files

** Overview

*** Quick pattern expansion
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

# : Find files or url: /path/to/default/directory/

- Enter =~/= at end of pattern to quickly reach home directory

- Enter =/= at end of pattern to quickly reach the file system root

- Enter =./= at end of pattern to quickly reach ~default-directory~

  The value of ~default-directory~ is the one at the beginning of the
  session.  If you already are in the ~default-directory~ this will
  move the cursor to the top.

- Enter =../= at end of pattern will reach upper directory, moving cursor to the top

  This is different from using {{{kbd(C-l)}}} in that it moves
  the cursor to the top instead of remaining on the previous subdir name.

- Enter =..name/= at end of pattern to start a recursive search

  It searches directories matching =name= under the current directory, see the
  "Recursive completion on subdirectories" section below for more details.

- Any environment variable (e.g. =$HOME=) at end of pattern gets expanded

- Any valid filename yanked after pattern gets expanded

- Special case: URL at point

  The quick expansions do not take effect at the end of a URL, you
  must kill the pattern first ({{{kbd(C-k)}}}).

Creating  a file or directory:

- To create a new file, enter a filename not ending with =/=

  Note that when you enter a new name, this one is prefixed with [?]
  if you are in a writable directory.  If you are in a directory where
  you have no write permission the new file name is not prefixed and
  is colored in red.  There is not such distinction when using Tramp,
  new filename just appears on top of buffer.

- To create a new directory, append a =/= to the new name and press
  {{{kbd(RET)}}}

- You can create a new directory and a new file at the same time

   Simply write the path in the prompt and press {{{kbd(RET)}}}, e.g.
   =~/new/newnew/newnewnew/my_newfile.txt=.

*** Helm-find-files supports fuzzy matching
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

Helm-find-files supports fuzzy matching. Narrowing by fuzzy matching
kicks in only when there are atleast 3 characters in the pattern.
What this means is this: If you have typed a pattern and do /not/ see
any filtering happening when you expect it to happen, do /not/ jump
the gun and conclude that fuzzy matching is broken.  It is possible
that your pattern is shorter than 3 characters, and you may have to
type more characters to see the filter at work.

*** Toggle auto-completion
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

It is useful when trying to create a new file or directory and you don’t want
Helm to complete what you are writing.

*Note*: On a terminal, the default binding {{{kbd(C-<backspace>)}}} may not work.
In this case use {{{kbd(C-c <backspace>)}}}.

*** Use the wildcard to select multiple files
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

Use of wildcard is supported to run an action over a set of files.

Example: You can copy all the files with =.el= extension by using =*.el= and
then run copy action.

Similarly, =**.el= (note the two stars) will recursively select all =.el=
files under the current directory.

The =**= feature is active by default in the option ~helm-file-globstar~.  It
is different from the Bash =shopt globstar= feature in that to list files with
a named extension recursively you would write =**.el= whereas in Bash it would
be =**/*.el=.  Directory selection with =**/= like Bash =shopt globstar=
option is not supported yet.

Helm supports different styles of wildcards:

- ‘sh’ style, the ones supported by ‘file-expand-wildcards’.
  e.g. =*.el=, =*.[ch]= which match respectively all =.el=
  files or all =.c= and =.h= files.

- ‘bash’ style (partially) In addition to what allowed in ‘sh’
  style you can specify file extensions that have more than one
  character like this: =*.{sh,py}= which match =.sh= and
  =.py= files.

Of course in both styles you can specify one or two =*=.

*** Navigation summary
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

For a better experience you can enable auto completion by setting
~helm-ff-auto-update-initial-value~ to non-nil in your init file.  It is not
enabled by default to not confuse new users.

- Navigate with arrow keys

  You can use <right> and <left> arrows to go down or up one level, to disable
  this customize ~helm-ff-lynx-style-map~.
  Note that using ~setq~ will NOT work.

- Use {{{kbd(C-j)}}} (persistent action) on a directory to go down one level

  On a symlinked directory a prefix argument expands to its true name.

- Use {{{kbd(C-l)}}} or {{{kbd(DEL)}}} on a directory to go up one level

  {{{kbd(DEL)}}} behavior

  {{{kbd(DEL)}}} by default deletes char backward.

  But when ~helm-ff-DEL-up-one-level-maybe~ is non nil {{{kbd(DEL)}}} behaves
  differently depending on the contents of helm-pattern.  It goes up one
  level if the pattern is a directory ending with =/= or disables HFF
  auto update and delete char backward if the pattern is a filename or
  refers to a non existing path.  Going up one level can be disabled
  if necessary by deleting =/= at the end of the pattern using
  {{{kbd(C-b)}}} and {{{kbd(C-k)}}}.

  Note that when deleting char backward, Helm takes care of
  disabling update giving you the opportunity to edit your pattern for
  e.g. renaming a file or creating a new file or directory.
  When ~helm-ff-auto-update-initial-value~ is non nil you may want to
  disable it temporarily, see [[Toggle auto-completion][Toggle auto-completion]] for this.

- Use {{{kbd(C-r)}}} to walk back the resulting tree of all the {{{kbd(C-l)}}} or DEL you did

  The tree is reinitialized each time you browse a new tree with
  {{{kbd(C-j)}}} or by entering some pattern in the prompt.

- {{{kbd(RET)}}} behavior

  It behaves differently depending on ~helm-selection~ (current candidate in helm-buffer):

  - candidate basename is =.= :: Open it in dired.
  - candidate is a directory    :: Expand it.
  - candidate is a file         :: Open it.

  If you have marked candidates and you press RET on a directory,
  Helm will navigate to this directory.  If you want to exit with
  RET with default action with these marked candidates, press RET a
  second time while you are on the root of this directory e.g.
  =/home/you/dir/.= or press RET on any file which is not a
  directory.  You can also exit with default action at any moment
  with {{{kbd(f1)}}}.

  Note that when copying, renaming, etc. from ~helm-find-files~ the
  destination file is selected with ~helm-read-file-name~.

- {{{kbd(TAB)}}} behavior

  Normally {{{kbd(TAB)}}} is bound to ~helm-select-action~ in helm-map which
  display the action menu.

  You can change this behavior by setting in ~helm-find-files-map~
  a new command for {{{kbd(TAB)}}}:

      #+begin_src elisp
	(define-key helm-find-files-map (kbd "C-i") ’helm-ff-TAB)
      #+end_src

  It will then behave slighly differently depending of
  ~helm-selection~:

  - candidate basename is =.=  :: open the action menu.
  - candidate is a directory     :: expand it (behave as C-j).
  - candidate is a file          :: open action menu.

  Called with a prefix arg open menu unconditionally.

- {{{kbd(C-j)}}} behaviour

  {{{kbd(C-j)}}} on a filename expands to that filename in the Helm
  buffer. Second hit displays the buffer filename. Third hit kills the
  buffer filename.

  {{{kbd(C-u C-j)}}} displays the buffer directly.

  If you have mounted your filesystem with mountavfs, you can expand
  archives in the =~/.avfs= directory with {{{kbd(C-j)}}}. Expand
  archives as directories in a avfs directory

*** Filter out files or directories
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

You can show files or directories only with respectively
{{{kbd(S-<f4>)}}} and {{{kbd(S-<f5>)}}}.
These are toggle commands i.e. filter/show_all.
Changing directory disable filtering.

*** Sort directory contents
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

When listing a directory without narrowing its contents, i.e. when pattern ends with =/=,
you can sort alphabetically, by newest or by size by using respectively
{{{kbd(S-<f1>)}}}, {{{kbd(S-<f2>)}}} or {{{kbd(S-<f3>)}}}.

*Note*:
When starting back narrowing i.e. entering something in minibuffer after =/= sorting is done
again with fuzzy sorting and no more with sorting methods previously selected.

** Operate on files

*** Create a file or a directory

*** Open files in separate windows

 When marking multiple files ([[*Marked candidates]]) or using wildcard
 ([[*Use the wildcard to select multiple files]]), helm allow opening all
 this files in separate windows using an horizontal layout or a
 vertical layout if you used a prefix arg, when no more windows can be
 displayed in frame, next files are opened in background without being
 displayed.  When using {{{kbd(C-c o)}}} the current
 buffer is kept and files are displayed next to it with same behavior as above.
 When using two prefix args, files are opened in background without beeing displayed.

*** Open files

**** Open files externally

 - Open file with external program ({{{kbd(C-c C-x)}}},{{{kbd(C-u)}}} to choose).

   Helm is looking what is used by default to open file
   externally (mailcap files) but have its own variable
   ~helm-external-programs-associations~ to store external
   applications.  If you call the action or its binding without
   prefix arg Helm will see if there is an application suitable in
   ~helm-external-programs-associations~, otherwise it will look in
   mailcap files.  If you want to specify which external application
   to use (and its options) use a prefix arg.

   Note: What you configure for Helm in ~helm-external-programs-associations~
   will take precedence on mailcap files.

 - Preview file with external program ({{{kbd(C-c C-v)}}}).

   Same as above but doesn’t quit Helm session, it is apersistent action.

 - Open file externally with default tool ({{{kbd(C-c X)}}}).

   This uses xdg-open which sucks most of the time, but perhaps it
   works fine on Windows.  This is why it is kept in Helm.

*** Browse images directories with ~helm-follow-mode~ and navigate up/down

 Before Emacs-27 Helm was using image-dired that works with
 external ImageMagick tools.  From Emacs-27 Helm use native
 display of images with image-mode by default for Emacs-27 (see ~helm-ff-display-image-native~),
 this allows automatic resize when changing window size, zooming with {{{kbd(M-+)}}} and {{{kbd(M--)}}}
 and rotate images as before.

 You can also use ~helm-follow-action-forward~ and ~helm-follow-action-backward~ with
 {{{kbd(C-<down>)}}} and {{{kbd(C-<up>)}}} respectively.
 Note that these commands have different behavior when ~helm-follow-mode~
 is enabled (go to next/previous line only).

 Use {{{kbd(C-u C-j)}}} to display an image or kill its buffer.

 *Tip*: Use {{{kbd(C-t)}}} and {{{kbd(C-{)}}} to display Helm window vertically
 and to enlarge it while viewing images.
 Note this may not work with exotic Helm windows settings such as the ones in Spacemacs.

*** Copy or Rename files

Note that when recursively copying files, you may have files with same name
dispatched across different subdirectories, so when copying them in the same
directory they will get overwritten.  To avoid this Helm has a special action
called =backup files= that has the same behavior as the command line "cp -f
--backup=numbered": it allows you to copy many files with the same name from
different subdirectories into one directory.  Files with same name are renamed
as follows: =foo.txt.~1~=.  Like with the --force option of cp, it is possible
to backup files in current directory.

This command is available only when ~dired-async-mode~ is active.

See [[*Use the wildcard to select multiple files][Use the wildcard to select multiple files]]

**** Query replace regexp on filenames

 Replace different parts of a file basename with something else.

 When calling this action you will be prompted twice as with
 ~query-replace~, first for the matching expression of the text to
 replace and second for the replacement text.  Several facilities,
 however, are provided to make the two prompts more powerfull.

***** Syntax of the first prompt

 In addition to simple regexps, these shortcuts are available:

 - Basename without extension :: =%.=
 - Only extension             :: =.%=
 - Substring                  :: =%:<from>:<to>=
 - Whole basename             :: =%=

***** Syntax of the second prompt

 In addition to a simple string to use as replacement, here is what you can use:

 - A placeholder refering to what you have selected in the first prompt: =\@=.

   After this placeholder you can use a search-and-replace syntax à-la sed:

       : "\@/<regexp>/<replacement>/

   You can select a substring from the string represented by the placeholder:

       : =\@:<from>:<to>=

 - A special character representing a number which is incremented: =\#=.

 - Shortcuts for ~upcase~, ~downcase~ and ~capitalize~
   are available as=%u=, =%d= and =%c= respectively.

***** Examples

****** Recursively rename all files with =.JPG= extension to =.jpg=

 Use the ~helm-file-globstar~ feature described in [[Use the wildcard to select multiple files][recursive globbing]]
 by entering =**.JPG= at the end of the Helm-find-files pattern, then hit
 {{{kbd(M-@)}}} and enter =JPG= on first prompt, then =jpg= on second prompt and hit {{{kbd(RET)}}}.

 Alternatively you can enter =.%= at the first prompt, then =jpg= and hit
 {{{kbd(RET)}}}.  Note that when using this instead of using =JPG= at the first prompt,
 all extensions will be renamed to =jpg= even if the extension of one of the
 files is, say, =png=.  If you want to keep the original extension you can use
 =%d= at the second prompt (downcase).

****** Batch-rename files from number 001 to 00x

 Use =\#= inside the second prompt.

 Example 1: To rename the files

     #+begin_example
     foo.jpg
     bar.jpg
     baz.jpg
     #+end_example

 to

     #+begin_example
     foo-001.jpg
     foo-002.jpg
     foo-003.jpg
     #+end_example

 use =%.= as matching regexp and =foo-\#= as replacement string.

 Example 2: To rename the files

     #+begin_example
     foo.jpg
     bar.jpg
     baz.jpg
     #+end_example

 to

     #+begin_example
     foo-001.jpg
     bar-002.jpg
     baz-003.jpg
     #+end_example

 use as matching regexp =%.= and as replacement string =\@-\#=.

****** Replace a substring

 Use =%:<from>:<to>=.

 Example: To rename files

     #+begin_example
     foo.jpg
     bar.jpg
     baz.jpg
     #+end_example

 to

     #+begin_example
     fOo.jpg
     bAr.jpg
     bAz.jpg
     #+end_example

 use as matching regexp =%:1:2= and as replacement string =%u= (upcase).

 Note that you *cannot* use =%.= and =.%= along with substring replacement.

****** Modify the string from the placeholder (\@)

 - By substring, i.e. only using the substring of the placeholder: =\@:<from>:<to>=.
   The length of placeholder is used for <to> when unspecified.

   Example 1: =\@:0:2= replaces from the beginning to the second char of the placeholder.

   Example 2: \@:2: replaces from the second char of the placeholder to the end.

 - By search-and-replace: =\@/<regexp>/<replacement>/=.

   Incremental replacement is also handled in <replacement>.

   Example 3: =\@/foo/bar/= replaces =foo= by =bar= in the placeholder.

   Example 4: =\@/foo/-\#/= replaces =foo= in the placeholder by 001, 002, etc.

****** Clash in replacements (avoid overwriting files)

 When performing any of these replacement operations you may end up with same
 names as replacement.  In such cases Helm numbers the file that would otherwise
 overwritten.  For instance, should you remove the =-m<n>= part from the files
 =emacs-m1.txt=, =emacs-m2.txt= and =emacs-m3.txt= you would end up with
 three files named =emacs.txt=, the second renaming overwriting first file, and
 the third renaming overwriting second file and so on.  Instead Helm will
 automatically rename the second and third files as =emacs(1).txt= and
 =emacs(2).txt= respectively.

****** Query-replace on filenames vs. serial-rename action

 Unlike the [[Serial renaming][serial rename]] actions, the files renamed with
 the query-replace action stay in their initial directory and are not moved to
 the current directory.  As such, using =\#= to serial-rename files only makes
 sense for files inside the same directory.  It even keeps renaming files
 with an incremental number in the next directories.

**** Serial renaming

 You can use the serial-rename actions to rename, copy or symlink marked files to
 a specific directory or in the current directory with all the files numbered
 incrementally.

 - Serial-rename by renaming ::
   Rename all marked files with incremental numbering to a specific directory.

 - Serial-rename by copying ::
   Copy all marked files with incremental numbering to a specific directory.

 - Serial-rename by symlinking ::
   Symlink all marked files with incremental numbering to a specific directory.

**** Defining default target directory for copying, renaming, etc

 You can customize ~helm-dwim-target~ to behave differently depending on the
 windows open in the current frame.  Default is to provide completion on all
 directories associated to each window.

**** Copying/Renaming from or to remote directories

 Never use ssh tramp method to copy/rename large files, use
 instead its scp method if you want to avoid out of memory
 problems and crash Emacs or the whole system.  Moreover when using
 scp method, you will hit a bug when copying more than 3 files at
 the time.[fn:5]
 The best way actually is using Rsync to copy files from or to
 remote, see [[Use Rsync to copy files][Use Rsync to copy files]].
 Also if you often work on remote you may consider using SSHFS
 instead of relying on tramp.

**** Copying and renaming asynchronously

 If you have the async library installed (if you got Helm from MELPA you do), you
 can use it for copying/renaming files by enabling ~dired-async-mode~.

 Note that even when async is enabled, running a copy/rename action with a prefix
 argument will execute action synchronously. Moreover it will follow the first
 file of the marked files in its destination directory.

 When ~dired-async-mode~ is enabled, an additional action named "Backup files"
 will be available. (Such command is not natively available in Emacs).
 See [[Use the wildcard to select multiple files]] for details.

**** Use Rsync to copy files

 If Rsync is available, you can use it to copy/sync files or directories
 with some restrictions though:

 - Copying from/to tramp sudo method may not work (permissions).

 - Copying from remote to remote is not supported (rsync restriction)
   however you can mount a remote with sshfs and copy to it (best), otherwise you have to modify
   the command line with a prefix arg.[fn:6]

 This command is mostly useful when copying large files as it is
 fast, asynchronous and provide a progress bar in mode-line.  Each
 rsync process have its own progress bar, so you can run several
 rsync jobs, they are independents.  If rsync fails you can
 consult the =*helm-rsync<n>*= buffer to see rsync errors.  An
 help-echo (move mouse over progress bar) is provided to see which
 file is in transfer.  Note that when copying directories, no
 trailing slashes are added to directory names, which mean that
 directory is created on destination if it doesn’t already exists,
 see rsync documentation for more infos on rsync behavior.  To
 synchronize a directory, mark all in the directory and rsync all
 marked to the destination directory or rsync the directory itself
 to its parent, e.g. =remote:/home/you/music= => =/home/you=.

 The options are configurable through ~helm-rsync-switches~, but
 you can modify them on the fly when needed by using a prefix arg,
 in this case you will be prompted for modifications.

 *Note*: When selecting a remote file, if you use the tramp syntax
 for specifying a port, i.e. host#2222, helm will add
 automatically =-e ’ssh -p 2222’= to the rsync command line
 unless you have specified yourself the =-e= option by editing
 rsync command line with a prefix arg (see above).

*** Touch files

 In the completion buffer, you can choose the default which is the current-time, it is
 the first candidate or the timestamp of one of the selected files.
 If you need to use something else, use {{{kbd(M-n)}}} and edit
 the date in minibuffer.
 It is also a way to quickly create a new file without opening a buffer, saving it
 and killing it.
 To touch more than one new file, separate you filenames with a comma (=,=).
 If one wants to create (touch) a new file with comma inside the name use a prefix arg,
 this will prevent splitting the name and create multiple files.

*** Delete files

 You can delete files without quitting helm with
 {{{kbd(C-c d)}}} or delete files and quit helm with {{{kbd(M-D)}}}.

 In the second method you can choose to
 make this command asynchronous by customizing
 ~helm-ff-delete-files-function~.

 *Warning*: When deleting files asynchronously you will NOT be
 WARNED if directories are not empty, that’s mean non empty directories will
 be deleted in background without asking.

 A good compromise is to trash your files
 when using asynchronous method (see [[Trashing files][Trashing files]]).

 When choosing synchronous delete, you can allow recursive
 deletion of directories with ~helm-ff-allow-recursive-deletes~.
 Note that when trashing (synchronous) you are not asked for recursive deletion.

 Note that ~helm-ff-allow-recursive-deletes~ have no effect when
 deleting asynchronously.

 First method (persistent delete) is always synchronous.

 Note that when a prefix arg is given, trashing behavior is inversed.
 See [[Trashing files][Trashing files]].

**** Trashing files

 If you want to trash your files instead of deleting them you can
 set ~delete-by-moving-to-trash~ to non nil, like this your files
 will be moved to trash instead of beeing deleted.

 You can reverse at any time the behavior of ~delete-by-moving-to-trash~ by using
 a prefix arg with any of the delete files command.

 On GNULinux distributions, when navigating to a Trash directory you
 can restore any file in ..Trash/files directory with the ’Restore
 from trash’ action you will find in action menu (needs the
 trash-cli package installed for remote files, see [[Trashing remote files with tramp][Here]]).
 You can as well delete files from Trash directories with the ’delete files from trash’
 action.
 If you want to know where a file will be restored, hit {{{kbd(M-i)}}}, you will find a trash info.

 *Tip*: Navigate to your Trash/files directories with ~helm-find-files~ and set a bookmark
 there with {{{kbd(C-x r m)}}} for fast access to Trash.

 *Note*: Restoring files from trash is working only on system using
 the freedesktop trash specifications.[fn:7]

 *Warning*:

 If you have an =ENV= var =XDG_DATA_HOME= in your .profile or .bash_profile
 and this var is set to something like =$HOME/.local/share= (like preconized)
 ~move-file-to-trash~ may try to create =$HOME/.local/share/Trash= (literally)
 and its subdirs in the directory where you are actually trying to trash files.
 because ~move-file-to-trash~ is interpreting =XDG_DATA_HOME= literally instead
 of evaling its value (with ~substitute-in-file-name~).

***** Trashing remote files with tramp

 Trashing remote files (or local files with sudo method) is disabled by default
 because tramp is requiring the ’trash’ command to be installed, if you want to
 trash your remote files, customize ~helm-trash-remote-files~.
 The package on most GNU/Linux based distributions is =trash-cli=[fn:8].

 *Note*:
 When deleting your files with sudo method, your trashed files will not be listed
 with trash-list until you log in as root.

*** Checksum file

 Checksum is calculated with the md5sum, sha1sum, sha224sum,
 sha256sum, sha384sum and sha512sum when available, otherwise the
 Emacs function ~secure-hash~ is used but it is slow and may crash
 Emacs and even the whole system as it eats all memory.  So if
 your system doesn’t have the md5 and sha command line tools be
 careful when checking sum of larges files e.g. isos.

*** Grep files

When using an action that involves an external backend (e.g. grep), using =**=
is not recommended (even thought it works fine) because it will be slower to
select all the files.  You are better off leaving the backend to do it, it will
be faster.  However, if you know you have not many files it is reasonable to use
this, also using not recursive wildcard (e.g. =*.el=) is perfectly fine for
this.

See [[Use the wildcard to select multiple files]] for details.

**** Grep files from ~helm-find-files~

 You can grep individual files from ~helm-find-files~ by using
 {{{kbd(C-s)}}}.  This same command can also
 recursively grep files from the current directory when called with a prefix
 argument.  In this case you will be prompted for the file extensions to use
 (grep backend) or the types of files to use (ack-grep backend).  See the
 ~helm-grep-default-command~ documentation to set this up.  For compressed files
 or archives, use zgrep with {{{kbd(M-g z)}}}.

 Otherwise you can use recursive commands like {{{kbd(M-g a)}}} or {{{kbd(M-g g)}}}
 that are much faster than using {{{kbd(C-s)}}} with a prefix argument.
 See ~helm-grep-ag-command~ and ~helm-grep-git-grep-command~ to set this up.

 You can also use =id-utils=’ GID with {{{kbd(M-g i)}}}
 by creating an ID index file with the =mkid= shell command.

 All those grep commands use the symbol at point as the default pattern.
 Note that default is different from input (nothing is added to the prompt until
 you hit {{{kbd(M-n)}}}).

***** Grepping on remote files

 On remote files grep is not well supported by TRAMP unless you suspend updates before
 entering the pattern and re-enable it once your pattern is ready.
 To toggle suspend-update, use {{{kbd(C-!)}}}.

**** Recursive search from Helm-find-files

***** You can use helm-browse-project (see binding below)

 - {{{kbd(M-x helm-browse-project)}}} ::
   If the current directory is under version control with either git or hg and
   helm-ls-git[fn:9] and/or helm-ls-hg[fn:10] are installed, it lists all the files under
   version control.  Otherwise it falls back to Helm-find-files.

 - {{{kbd(C-u M-x helm-browse-project)}}} ::
   List all the files under this directory and other subdirectories
   (recursion) and this list of files will be cached.

 - {{{kbd(C-u C-u M-x helm-browse-project)}}} ::
   Same but the cache is refreshed.

***** You can start a recursive search with =locate=, =find= or =Fd=[fn:11]

 See "Note" in the [[Recursive completion on subdirectories][section on subdirectories]].

 Using =locate=, you can enable the local database with a prefix argument. If the
 local database doesn’t already exists, you will be prompted for its creation.
 If it exists and you want to refresh it, give it two prefix args.

 When using locate the Helm buffer remains empty until you type something.
 Regardless Helm uses the basename of the pattern entered in the helm-find-files
 session by default.  Hitting {{{kbd(M-n)}}} should just kick in the
 locate search with this pattern.  If you want Helm to automatically do this, add
 ~helm-source-locate~ to ~helm-sources-using-default-as-input~.

 *Note*: On Windows use Everything with its command line ~es~ as a replacement of locate.[fn:12]

***** Recursive completion on subdirectories

 Starting from the directory you are currently browsing, it is possible to have
 completion of all directories underneath.  Say you are at =/home/you/foo/= and
 you want to go to =/home/you/foo/bar/baz/somewhere/else=, simply type
 =/home/you/foo/..else= and hit {{{kbd(C-j)}}} or enter
 the final =/=.  Helm will then list all possible directories under =foo=
 matching =else=.

 *Note*: Completion on subdirectories uses =locate= as backend, you can configure
 the command with ~helm-locate-recursive-dirs-command~.  Because this completion
 uses an index, the directory tree displayed may be out-of-date and not reflect
 the latest change until you update the index (using =updatedb= for =locate=).

 If for some reason you cannot use an index, the =find= command from
 =findutils= can be used instead.  It will be slower though.  You need to pass
 the basedir as first argument of =find= and the subdir as the value for
 ’-(i)regex’ or ’-(i)name’ with the two format specs that are mandatory in
 ~helm-locate-recursive-dirs-command~.

 Examples:

 : find %s -type d -name ’*%s*’
 : find %s -type d -regex .*%s.*$

 =Fd=[fn:11] command is now also
 supported which is regexp based and very fast.  Here is the command
 line to use:

 : fd --hidden --type d .*%s.*$ %s

 You can use also a glob based search, in this case use the --glob option:

 : fd --hidden --type d --glob ’*%s*’ %s

*** Execute Eshell commands on files

Setting up aliases in Eshell allows you to set up powerful customized commands.

Your aliases for using eshell command on file should allow
specifying one or more files, use e.g. =alias foo $1= or
=alias foo $*=, if you want your command to be asynchronous add
at end =&=, e.g. =alias foo $* &=.

Adding Eshell aliases to your ~eshell-aliases-file~ or using the
=alias= command from Eshell allows you to create personalized
commands not available in ~helm-find-files~ actions and use them
from {{{kbd(M-!)}}}.

Example: You want a command to uncompress some =*.tar.gz= files from ~helm-find-files~:

1) Create an Eshell alias named, say, =untargz= with the command
=alias untargz tar zxvf $*=.

2) Now from ~helm-find-files~ select the =*.tar.gz= file (you can also
mark files if needed) and hit {{{kbd(M-!)}}}.

*Note*: When using marked files with this, the meaning of the prefix argument is
quite subtle.  Say you have =foo=, =bar= and =baz= marked; when you run
the alias command ‘example’ on these files with no prefix argument it will run
‘example’ sequentially on each file:

: $ example foo
: $ example bar
: $ example baz

With a prefix argument however it will apply ‘example’ on all files at once:

: $ example foo bar baz

Of course the alias command should support this.

If you add %s to the command line %s will be replaced with the candidate, this mean you can
add extra argument to your command e.g. command -extra-arg %s or command %s -extra-arg.
If you want to pass many files inside %s, don’t forget to use a prefix arg.

You can also use special placeholders in extra-args,
see the specific info page once you hit {{{kbd(M-!)}}}.

*** Attach files to a mail buffer (message-mode)

If you are in a ~message-mode~ or ~mail-mode~ buffer, that action will appear
in action menu, otherwise it is available at any time with {{{kbd(C-c C-a)}}}.
It behaves as follows:

- If you are in a (mail or message) buffer, files are attached there.

- If you are not in a mail buffer but one or more mail buffers exist, you are
  prompted to attach files to one of these mail buffers.

- If you are not in a mail buffer and no mail buffer exists,
  a new mail buffer is created with the attached files in it.

** Working on Remote files with TRAMP

*** Tramp archive support (emacs-27+ only)
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

If your emacs have library tramp-archive.el, you can browse the
content of archives with emacs and BTW helm-find-files. However this beeing
experimental and not very fast, helm doesn’t provide an automatic
expansion and detection of archives, you will have to add the final =/=
manually and may have to force update ({{{kbd(C-c C-u)}}})
or remove and add again the final =/= until tramp finish decompressing archive.

*** Using TRAMP with ~helm-find-files~ to read remote directories
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

~helm-find-files~ works fine with TRAMP despite some limitations.

- Grepping files is not very well supported when used incrementally.
  See [[Grepping on remote files]].

- Locate does not work on remote directories.

**** A TRAMP syntax crash course

Please refer to TRAMP’s documentation for more details.

- Connect to host 192.168.0.4 as user =foo=:

  : /scp:192.168.0.4@foo:

- Connect to host 192.168.0.4 as user =foo= on port 2222:

  : /scp:192.168.0.4@foo#2222:

- Connect to host 192.168.0.4 as root using multihops syntax:

  : /ssh:192.168.0.4@foo|sudo:192.168.0.4:

*Note*: You can also use ~tramp-default-proxies-alist~ when connecting often to
the same hosts.

As a rule of thumb, prefer the scp method unless using multihops (which only
works with the ssh method), especially when copying large files.

You need to hit {{{kbd(C-j)}}} once on top of a directory on the first connection
to complete the pattern in the minibuffer.

**** Display color for directories, symlinks etc... with tramp

Starting at helm version 2.9.7 it is somewhat possible to
colorize fnames by listing files without loosing performances with
external commands (ls and awk) if your system is compatible.
For this you can use ~helm-list-dir-external~ as value
for ~helm-list-directory-function~.

See ~helm-list-directory-function~ documentation for more infos.

**** Completing host

As soon as you enter the first =:= after method e.g =/scp:= you will
have some completion about previously used hosts or from your =~/.ssh/config=
file, hitting {{{kbd(C-j)}}} or {{{kbd(right)}}} on a candidate will insert this host in minibuffer
without addind the ending =:=, second hit insert the last =:=.
As soon the last =:= is entered TRAMP will kick in and you should see the list
of candidates soon after.

When connection fails, be sure to delete your TRAMP connection with
 {{{kbd(M-x helm-delete-tramp-connection
)}}} before retrying.

**** Editing local files as root

Use the sudo method:

: /sudo:host:

or

: simply /sudo::.

** Misc. Remarks

*** Find file at point

Helm uses ~ffap~ partially or completely to find file at point depending on the
value of ~helm-ff-guess-ffap-filenames~: if non-nil, support is complete
(annoying), if nil, support is partial.

Note that when the variable
~helm-ff-allow-non-existing-file-at-point~ is non nil Helm will
insert the filename at point even if file with this name doesn’t
exists.  If non existing file at point ends with numbers prefixed
with =:= the =:= and numbers are stripped.

**** Find file at line number

When text at point is in the form of

    : ~/elisp/helm/helm.el:1234

Helm finds this file at the indicated line number, here 1234.

**** Find URL at point

When a URL is found at point, Helm expands to that URL only.
Pressing {{{kbd(RET)}}} opens that URL using ~browse-url-browser-function~.

**** Find e-mail address at point

When an e-mail address is found at point, Helm expands to this e-mail address
prefixed with =mailto:=.  Pressing {{{kbd(RET)}}} opens a message buffer with that
e-mail address.

*** Insert filename at point or complete filename at point

On insertion (not on completion, i.e. there is nothing at point):

- {{{kbd(C-c i)}}} ::  insert absolute file name.
- {{{kbd(C-u C-c i)}}} ::  insert abbreviated file name.
- {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-c i)}}} ::  insert relative file name.
- {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-u C-c i)}}} ::  insert basename.

On completion:

- Target starts with =~/= :: insert abbreviate file name.
- target starts with =/= or =[a-z]:/= :: insert full path.
- Otherwise :: insert relative file name.

*** Edit marked files in a dired buffer

You can open a dired buffer containing only marked files with {{{kbd(C-x C-q)}}}.
With a prefix argument you can open this same dired buffer in wdired mode for
editing.  Note that wildcards are supported as well, so you can use e.g.
=*.txt= to select all =.txt= files in the current directory or =**.txt= to
select all files recursively from the current directory.
See [[Use the wildcard to select multiple files]] section above.

*** Bookmark the ~helm-find-files~ session

You can bookmark the ~helm-find-files~ session with {{{kbd(C-x r m)}}}.
You can later retrieve these bookmarks by calling ~helm-filtered-bookmarks~
or, from the current ~helm-find-files~ session, by hitting {{{kbd(C-x r b)}}}.

*** Ignored or boring files

Helm-find-files can ignore files matching
~helm-boring-file-regexp-list~ or files that are git ignored, you
can set this with ~helm-ff-skip-boring-files~ or
~helm-ff-skip-git-ignored-files~.

*Note*: This will slow down helm, be warned.

*** Helm-find-files is using a cache

Helm is caching each directory files list in a hash table for
faster search, when a directory is modified it is removed from cache
so that further visit in this directory refresh cache.
You may have in some rare cases to refresh directory manually with {{{kbd(C-c C-u)}}}
for example when helm-find-files session is running and a file is modified/deleted
in current visited directory by an external command from outside Emacs.

* Helm ‘generic’ read file name completion

This is ‘generic’ read file name completion that have been =helmized=
because you have enabled [[Helm mode][helm-mode]].
Don’t confuse this with ~helm-find-files~ which is a native helm command,
see [[Helm functions vs helmized Emacs functions]].

** Tips

*** Navigation

**** Enter =~/= at end of pattern to quickly reach home directory

**** Enter =/= at end of pattern to quickly reach the file system root

**** Enter =./= at end of pattern to quickly reach ~default-directory~

(As per its value at the beginning of the session.)

If you already are in the ~default-directory~ this will move the cursor to the top.

**** Enter =../= at end of pattern will reach upper directory, moving cursor on top

This is different from using {{{kbd(M-x helm-find-files-up-one-level)}}} in that it moves
the cursor to the top instead of remaining on the previous subdir name.

**** You can complete with partial basename

It starts from the third character of the pattern.

For instance =fob= or =fbr= will complete =foobar= but =fb= needs a
third character in order to complete it.

*** Persistent actions

By default ~helm-read-file-name~ uses the persistent actions of ~helm-find-files~.

**** Use {{{kbd(C-u C-j)}}} to display an image

**** {{{kbd(C-j)}}} on a filename will expand to this filename in Helm-buffer

Second hit displays the buffer filename.
Third hit kills the buffer filename.

*Note*: {{{kbd(C-u C-j)}}} displays the buffer directly.

**** Browse images directories with ~helm-follow-mode~ and navigate up/down

*** Delete characters backward

When you want to delete characters backward, e.g. to create a new file or directory,
auto-update may come in the way when it keeps updating to an existent directory.
In that case, type {{{kbd(C-<backspace>)}}} and then ‘<backspace>’.
This should not be needed when copying/renaming files because autoupdate is disabled
by default in that case.

*Note*: On a terminal, the default binding {{{kbd(C-<backspace>)}}} may not work.
In this case use {{{kbd(C-c <backspace>)}}}.

*** Create new directories and files

**** You can create a new directory and a new file at the same time

Simply write the path in prompt and press {{{kbd(RET)}}}, e.g.
=~/new/newnew/newnewnew/my_newfile.txt=.

**** To create a new directory, append a =/= at to the new name and press {{{kbd(RET)}}}

**** To create a new file, enter a filename not ending with =/=

File and directory creation works only with some commands (e.g. ~find-file~)
and it will not work with others where it is not intended to return a file or
a directory (e.g ~list-directory~).

*** Exiting minibuffer with empty string

You can exit minibuffer with empty string with
Uses keymap ~helm-read-file--map~, which is not currently defined.
{{{kbd(M-x helm-cr-empty-string)}}}.
It is useful when some commands are prompting continuously until you enter an empty prompt.

** Commands

| Keys    | Description                                         |

| C-]     | Toggle basename.                                    |
| C-c h   | File name history.                                  |
| C/M-RET | Return empty string unless ‘must-match’ is non-nil. |
| C-o     | Go to next source.                                  |
| M-o     | Go to previous source.                              |

* Helm Generic files

** Tips

*** Locate

You can append to the search pattern any of the locate command line options,
e.g. =-b=, =-e=, =-n <number>=, etc.  See the locate(1) man page for more details.

Some other sources (at the moment =recentf= and =file in current directory=)
support the =-b= flag for compatibility with locate when they are used with it.

When you enable fuzzy matching on locate with ~helm-locate-fuzzy-match~, the
search will be performed on basename only for efficiency (so don’t add =-b= at
prompt).  As soon as you separate the patterns with spaces, fuzzy matching will
be disabled and search will be done on the full filename.  Note that in
multi-match, fuzzy is completely disabled, which means that each pattern is a
match regexp (i.e. =helm= will match =helm= but =hlm= will *not* match
=helm=).

*Note*: On Windows use Everything with its command line ~es~ as a replacement of locate.[fn:13]

*** Browse project

When the current directory is not under version control, don’t forget to refresh
the cache when files have been added/removed in the directory.

*** Find command

Recursively search files using the =find= shell command.

Candidates are all filenames that match all given globbing patterns.  This
respects the options ~helm-case-fold-search~ and
~helm-findutils-search-full-path~.

You can pass arbitrary =find= options directly after a =*= separator.
For example, this would find all files matching =book= that are larger
than 1 megabyte:

    : book * -size +1M

* Helm fd

** Tips

The Fd[fn:11] command line tool is very fast to search files
recursively.  You may have to wait several seconds at first usage when
your hard drive cache is =cold=, then once the cache is initialized
searchs are very fast.  You can pass any Fd options[fn:14] before
pattern, e.g. =-e py foo=.

The Fd command line can be customized with ~helm-fd-switches~ user
variable.  Always use =--color always= as option otherwise you will
have no colors. To customize colors see Fd colorized[fn:15].

*Note*:
Starting from fd version 8.2.1, you have to provide the env var
LS_COLORS to Emacs to have a colorized output, the easiest way is
to add to your =~/.profile= file =eval $(dircolors)=.
Another way is using =setenv= in your init file.
This is not needed when running Emacs from a terminal either with =emacs -nw=
or =emacs= because emacs inherit the env vars of this terminal.[fn:16]

Search is (pcre) regexp based[fn:17], and multi patterns are _not_ supported.

** COMMENT Man page

NAME
       fd - find entries in the filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       fd  [-HIEsiaLp0hV]  [-d  depth] [-t filetype] [-e ext] [-E exclude] [-c
       when] [-j num] [-x cmd] [pattern] [path...]

DESCRIPTION
       fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find(1).

OPTIONS
       -H, --hidden
	      Include hidden files  and  directories  in  the  search  results
	      (default: hidden files and directories are skipped).

       -I, --no-ignore
	      Show search results from files and directories that would other‐
	      wise be ignored by .gitignore, .ignore, .fdignore, or the global
	      ignore file.

       -u, --unrestricted
	      Alias  for ’--no-ignore’. Can be repeated; ’-uu’ is an alias for
	      ’--no-ignore --hidden’.

       --no-ignore-vcs
	      Show search results from files and directories that would other‐
	      wise be ignored by .gitignore files.

       -s, --case-sensitive
	      Perform a case-sensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insen‐
	      sitive searches, unless the pattern contains an uppercase  char‐
	      acter (smart case).

       -i, --ignore-case
	      Perform  a  case-insensitive  search.  By default, fd uses case-
	      insensitive searches, unless the pattern contains  an  uppercase
	      character (smart case).

       -g, --glob
	      Perform  a  glob-based  search  instead  of a regular expression
	      search.

       --regex
	      Perform a regular-expression based seach (default). This can  be
	      used to override --glob.

       -F, --fixed-strings
	      Treat  the  pattern  as  a  literal  string instead of a regular
	      expression.

       -a, --absolute-path
	      Shows the full path starting from the root as opposed  to  rela‐
	      tive paths.

       -l, --list-details
	      Use a detailed listing format like ’ls -l’. This is basically an
	      alias  for  ’--exec-batch  ls  -l’  with  some  additional  ’ls’
	      options.  This can be used to see more metadata, to show symlink
	      targets and to achieve a deterministic sort order.

       -L, --follow
	      By default, fd does  not  descend  into  symlinked  directories.
	      Using this flag, symbolic links are also traversed.

       -p, --full-path
	      By default, the search pattern is only matched against the file‐
	      name (or directory  name).  Using  this  flag,  the  pattern  is
	      matched against the full path.

       -0, --print0
	      Separate  search  results by the null character (instead of new‐
	      lines). Useful for piping results to xargs.

       --max-results count
	      Limit the number of search results to ’count’ and  quit  immedi‐
	      ately.

       -1     Limit  the  search to a single result and quit immediately. This
	      is an alias for ’--max-results=1’.

       --show-errors
	      Enable the display of filesystem errors for situations  such  as
	      insufficient permissions or dead symlinks.

       --one-file-system, --mount, --xdev
	      By  default,  fd  will  traverse  the file system tree as far as
	      other options dictate. With this flag, fd ensures that  it  does
	      not descend into a different file system than the one it started
	      in. Comparable to the -mount or -xdev filters of find(1).

       -h, --help
	      Print help information.

       -V, --version
	      Print version information.

       -d, --max-depth d
	      Limit directory traversal to at  most  d  levels  of  depth.  By
	      default, there is no limit on the search depth.

       --min-depth d
	      Only  show search results starting at the given depth. See also:
	      ’--max-depth’ and ’--exact-depth’.

       --exact-depth d
	      Only show search results at the exact given depth.  This  is  an
	      alias for ’--min-depth <depth> --max-depth <depth>’.

       -t, --type filetype
	      Filter search by type:

	      f, file
		     regular files

	      d, directory
		     directories

	      l, symlink
		     symbolic links

	      x, executable
		     executable (files)

	      e, empty
		     empty files or directories

	      s, socket
		     sockets

	      p, pipe
		     named pipes (FIFOs)

	      This  option  can  be used repeatedly to allow for multiple file
	      types.

       -e, --extension ext
	      Filter search results by file extension ext.  This option can be
	      used repeatedly to allow for multiple possible file extensions.

       -E, --exclude pattern
	      Exclude  files/directories  that  match  the given glob pattern.
	      This overrides any other ignore logic.   Multiple  exclude  pat‐
	      terns can be specified.

       --ignore-file path
	      Add  a  custom  ignore-file in ’.gitignore’ format.  These files
	      have a low precedence.

       -c, --color when
	      Declare when to colorize search results:

	      auto   Colorize output when standard output is connected to terminal (default).

	      never  Do not colorize output.

	      always Always colorize output.

       -j, --threads num
	      Set number of threads to use for searching & executing (default:

* Helm Grep

** Tips

With Helm supporting Git-grep and AG/RG, you are better off using
one of them for recursive searches, keeping grep or ack-grep to
grep individual or marked files.  See [[Helm AG][Helm AG]].

*** Meaning of the prefix argument

**** With grep or ack-grep

Grep recursively, in this case you are
prompted for types (ack-grep) or for wild cards (grep).

**** With AG or RG

the prefix arg allows you to specify a type of file to search in.

*** You can use wild cards when selecting files (e.g. =*.el=)

Note that a way to grep specific files recursively is to use
e.g. =**.el= to select files, the variable ~helm-file-globstar~
controls this (it is non nil by default), however it is much
slower than using grep recusively (see helm-find-files
documentation about this feature).

*** Grep hidden files

You may want to customize your command line for grepping hidden
files, for AG/RG use =--hidden=, see man page
of your backend for more infos.

*** You can grep in different directories by marking files or using wild cards

*** You can save the result in a ~helm-grep-mode~ buffer

See [[Commands][commands]] below.

Once in that buffer you can use =emacs-wgrep=[fn:18] to edit your
changes, for Helm the package name is =wgrep-helm=, it is hightly
recommended.

*** Helm-grep supports multi-matching

(Starting from version 1.9.4.)

Simply add a space between each pattern as for most Helm commands.

*Note*: Depending the regexp you use it may match as well the
filename, this because we pipe the first grep command which send
the filename in output.

*** See full path of selected candidate

Add (helm-popup-tip-mode 1) in your init file or enable it
interactively with {{{kbd(M-x helm-popup-tip-mode,)}}} however it is
generally enough to just put your mouse cursor over candidate.

*** Open file in other window

The command {{{kbd(C-c o)}}} allow you to open file
in other window horizontally or vertically if a prefix arg is supplied.

*** Performance over TRAMP

Grepping works but it is badly supported as TRAMP doesn’t support multiple
processes running in a short delay (less than 5s) among other things.

Helm uses a special hook to suspend the process automatically while you are
typing.  Even if Helm handles this automatically by delaying each process by 5s,
you are adviced to this manually by hitting {{{kbd(C-!)}}} (suspend process) before
typing, and hit again {{{kbd(C-!)}}} when the regexp is ready to send to the remote
process.  For simple regexps, there should be no need for this.

Another solution is to not use TRAMP at all and mount your remote file system via
SSHFS.

* Helm GID

Still supported, but mostly deprecated, using AG/RG or Git-grep
is much more efficient, also =id-utils= seems no more maintained.

** Tips

Helm-GID reads the database created with the =mkid= command from id-utils.
The name of the database file can be customized with ~helm-gid-db-file-name~, it
is usually =ID=.

Helm-GID use the symbol at point as default-input.  This command is also
accessible from ~helm-find-files~ which allow you to navigate to another
directory to consult its database.

*Note*: Helm-GID supports multi-matches but only the last pattern entered will be
highlighted since there is no ~--color~-like option in GID itself.

* Helm AG

** Tips

Helm-AG is different from grep or ack-grep in that it works on a
directory recursively and not on a list of files.  It is called
helm-AG but it support several backend, namely AG, RG and PT.
Nowaday the best backend is Ripgrep aka RG, it is the fastest and
is actively maintained, see ~helm-grep-ag-command~ and
~helm-grep-ag-pipe-cmd-switches~ to configure it.

You can ignore files and directories with a =.agignore= file, local to a
directory or global when placed in the home directory. (See the AG man page for
more details.)  That file follows the same syntax as ~helm-grep-ignored-files~
and ~helm-grep-ignored-directories~.

As always you can access Helm AG from ~helm-find-files~.

Starting with version 0.30, AG accepts one or more TYPE arguments on its command
line.  Helm provides completion on these TYPE arguments when available with your
AG version.  Use a prefix argument when starting a Helm-AG session to enable this
completion.  See RG and AG man pages on how to add new types.

*Note*: You can mark several types to match in the AG query.  The first AG
versions providing this feature allowed only one type, so in this case only the
last mark will be used.

* Helm git-grep

Helm-git-grep searches the current directory, i.e. the default directory or the
directory in Helm-find-files.  If this current directory is a subdirectory of a
project and you want to also match parent directories (i.e the whole project),
use a prefix argument.

* Helm Eshell on file

** Tips

*** Pass extra arguments after filename

Normally the command or alias will be called with file as argument.  For instance

    : <command> candidate_file

But you can also pass an argument or more after =candidate_file= like this:

    : <command> %s [extra_args]

=candidate_file= will be added at =%s= and the command will look at this:

    : <command> candidate_file [extra_args]

**** Use placeholders in extra arguments

placeholder for file without extension: \@
placeholder for incremental number:     \#

=candidate_file= will be added at =%s= and \@ but without extension.

    : <command %s \@>

=candidate_file= will be added at =%s= and \# will be replaced by an incremental number.

    : <command> %s \#

Here examples:

Say you want to use the =convert= command to convert all your .png files in a directory to .jpg.

This will convert all your files to jpg keeping the same basename.

    : convert %s \@.jpg

This will convert all your files to foo-001.jpg, foo-002.jpg etc...

    : convert %s foo-\#.jpg

You can of course combine both placeholders if needed.

    : convert %s \@-\#.jpg

*** Specify marked files as arguments

Example:

    : <command> file1 file2...

Call ~helm-find-files-eshell-command-on-file~ with one prefix argument.  Otherwise
you can pass one prefix argument from the command selection buffer.

*Note*: This does not work on remote files.

With two prefix-args the output is printed to the ~current-buffer~.

With no prefix argument or a prefix argument value of ’(16) ({{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}})
the command is called once for each file like this:

    : <command> file1
    : <command> file2
    : ...

*** Run eshell commands asynchronously

You can run your commands asynchronously by adding =&= at end
of any commands, e.g. =foo %s &=.  You can also directly setup
your alias in the eshell alias file with e.g. =alias foo $1 &=.

*Note*: If you use =&= in a command with marked files and your
command accept many files as argument don’t forget to pass the
prefix arg to ensure you run only one command on all marked async.

** Commands

Uses keymap ~helm-esh-on-file-map~, which is not currently defined.

* Helm Ido virtual buffers

** Commands

Uses keymap ~helm-buffers-ido-virtual-map~, which is not currently defined.

| Keys                                 | Description             |
|--------------------------------------+-------------------------|
| M-x helm-ff-run-switch-other-window  | Switch to other window. |
| M-x helm-ff-run-switch-other-frame   | Switch to other frame.  |
| M-x helm-ff-run-grep                 | Grep file.              |
| M-x helm-ff-run-zgrep                | Zgrep file.             |
| M-x helm-ff-run-delete-file          | Delete file.            |
| M-x helm-ff-run-open-file-externally | Open file externally.   |

* Helm Moccur

** Tips

*** Searching in many buffers

Start from ~helm-buffers-list~ or ~helm-mini~, mark some buffers and hit
Uses keymap ‘helm-buffer-map\[helm-buffers-run-occur].
A prefix arg will change the behavior of `helm-occur-always-search-in-current'
i.e. add current buffer or not to the list of buffers to search in.

*** Matching

Multiple regexp matching is allowed, simply enter a space to separate the regexps.

Matching empty lines is supported with the regexp =^$=, you then get the
results displayed as the buffer-name and the line number only.  You can
save and edit these results, i.e. add text to the empty line.

*** Automatically match symbol at point

Helm can automatically match the symbol at point while keeping
the minibuffer empty, ready to be written to when
`helm-source-occur' and `helm-source-moccur' are member of
`helm-sources-using-default-as-input'.

*** Yank word at point in minibuffer

Use {{{kbd(C-w)}}} as many times as needed, undo with {{{kbd(C-_)}}}.  Note that
{{{kbd(C-w)}}} and {{{kbd(C-_)}}} are not standard keybindings, but bindings
provided with special helm feature
`helm-define-key-with-subkeys'.

*** Preselection

When helm-occur search symbol at point the current line is
preselected in the source related to current-buffer.  When
`helm-occur-keep-closest-position' is non nil helm-occur will
select the line which is the closest from the current line in
current-buffer after updating.

*** Jump to the corresponding line in the searched buffer

You can do this with `\<helm-map’, which is not currently defined.
{{{kbd(M-x helm-execute-persistent-action’)}}} (persistent-action), to do it repeatedly
you can use {{{kbd(C-<down>)}}} and {{{kbd(C-<up>)}}} or enable ~helm-follow-mode~ with {{{kbd(C-c C-f)}}}.
Follow mode is enabled by default in helm-occur.

*** Switch to buffer in other window

The command
Uses keymap ~helm-moccur-map~, which is not currently defined.
{{{kbd(M-x helm-moccur-run-goto-line-ow)}}} allow you to switch to buffer
in other window horizontally or vertically if a prefix arg is supplied.

*** Save the results

Similarly to Helm-grep, you can save the results with {{{kbd(C-x C-s)}}}.
Once in the saved buffer, you can edit it, see [[Edit a saved buffer][below]].

Of course if you don’t save the results, you can resume the Helm session with
~helm-resume~.

*** Refresh the resumed session

When the buffer(s) where you ran helm-(m)occur get(s) modified, the Helm buffer
will flash red as a warning.  You can refresh the buffer by running {{{kbd(C-c C-u)}}}.
This can be done automatically by customizing ~helm-moccur-auto-update-on-resume~.

*** Refresh a saved buffer

Type {{{kbd(g)}}} to update the buffer.

*** Edit a saved buffer

First, install =wgrep=[fn:19] and then:

1. {{{kbd(C-c C-p)}}} (~wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode~) to edit the buffer(s).
2. {{{kbd(C-x C-s)}}} to save your changes.

*Tip*: Use the excellent =iedit=[fn:20] to modify all
occurences at once in the buffer.

*** Search in region

When searching in current-buffer with ~helm-occur~, if a region
is found helm will search in this region only.  If you marked
this region with ~mark-defun~ the symbol that was at point before
marking defun will be used when ~helm-source-occur~ is member of
~helm-sources-using-default-as-input~.

*** Switch to next or previous source

See [[Moving in ‘helm-buffer’][Moving in ‘helm-buffer’]].

| M-x helm-top-run-sort-by-user | Sort alphabetically by user. |
| M-x helm-top-run-sort-by-mem  | Sort by memory.              |

* Helm Elisp package

** Tips

*** Compile all your packages asynchronously

If you use async (if you have installed Helm from MELPA you do), only =helm=,
=helm-core=, and =magit= are compiled asynchronously.  If you want all your
packages compiled asynchronously, add this to your init file:

     (setq async-bytecomp-allowed-packages ’(all))

*** Upgrade Elisp packages

On initialization (when Emacs is fetching packages on remote), if Helm finds
packages to upgrade, it will start in the upgradable packages view showing the packages
available for upgrade.

On subsequent runs, you will have to refresh the list with {{{kbd(C-c C-u)}}}.  If Helm
finds upgrades you can switch to upgrade view (see below) to see what packages
are available for upgrade or simply hit {{{kbd(C-c U)}}} to upgrade them all.

To see upgradable packages hit {{{kbd(M-U)}}}.

Then you can install all upgradable packages with the =upgrade all= action
({{{kbd(C-c C-u)}}}), or upgrade only specific packages by marking them and running the
=upgrade= action (visible only when there are upgradable packages).  Of course
you can upgrade a single package by just running the =upgrade= action without
marking it ({{{kbd(C-c u)}}} or {{{kbd(RET)}}}) .

*Warning:* You are strongly advised to *restart* Emacs after *upgrading* packages.

*** Meaning of flags prefixing packages

(Emacs ≥25)

- The flag =S= that prefixes package names means that the packages belong to ~package-selected-packages~.

- The flag =U= that prefix package names mean that this package is no more needed.

** Commands

Uses keymap ~helm-el-package-map~, which is not currently defined.

* Helm M-x

** Tips

*** You can get help on any command with persistent action (C-j)

*** Prefix arguments

You can pass prefix arguments *after* starting ~helm-M-x~.  A mode-line
counter will display the number of given prefix arguments.

If you pass prefix arguments before running ~helm-M-x~, it will be displayed in the prompt.
The first {{{kbd(C-u)}}} after ~helm-M-x~ clears those prefix arguments.

*Note*: When you specify prefix arguments once ~helm-M-x~ is
started, the prefix argument apply on the next command, so if you
hit RET, it will apply on the selected command, but if you type a
new character at prompt to narrow down further candidates, the
prefix arg will apply to ~self-insert-command~ (e.g. if you type
{{{kbd(C-u e)}}} =eeee= will be inserted in prompt) so select the
command you want to execute before specifying prefix arg.

*** Completion styles in {{{kbd(helm-M-x)}}}

By default {{{kbd(helm-M-x)}}} use ’helm completion style, if you want to enable fuzzy matching aka flex,
see [[Completion-styles][Completion-styles]].

*** Duplicate entries in helm-M-x history

helm-M-x history obey to history variables, if you have
duplicates in your helm-M-x history set ~history-delete-duplicates~ to non nil.

* Helm Imenu

* Helm Semantic

** Commands

Uses keymap ~helm-semantic-map~, which is not currently defined.

* Helm kmacro

** Tips

- Start recording a kmacro with {{{kbd(f3)}}}.
- End the kmacro recording with {{{kbd(f4)}}}.
- Run ~helm-execute-kmacro~ to list all your kmacros.

Use persistent action to run your kmacro as many times as needed.
You can browse the kmacros with ~helm-next-line~ and ~helm-previous-line~.

*Note*: You can’t record keys running Helm commands except ~helm-M-x~, under the
condition that you don’t choose a command using Helm completion.

** Commands

Uses keymap ~helm-kmacro-map~, which is not currently defined.

* Helm kill ring

** Tips

Every Helm session lets you save a candidate to the kill-ring / clipboard /
primary-selection with {{{kbd(C-c C-k)}}}.

To save space, Helm-kill-ring truncates the candidates longer than
~helm-kill-ring-max-offset~.
‘
Uses keymap ~helm-kill-ring-map~, which is not currently defined.
{{{kbd(M-x helm-kill-ring-kill-selection)}}}’ then saves the whole
text and not the truncated value.  The view of truncated candidates can be
toggled; see the command list below.

As opposed to ~yank~, numeric prefix arguments are ignored with
~helm-show-kill-ring~: there is no need for them since selection happens within
Helm.  Moreover Helm has [[Shortcuts for executing the default action on the n-th candidate][Shortcuts for executing the default action on the n-th candidate]].

It is recommended to globally bind {{{kbd(M-y)}}} to ~helm-show-kill-ring~.  Once in the
Helm-kill-ring session you can navigate to next/previous line with {{{kbd(M-y)}}} and
{{{kbd(M-u)}}} for convenience.  Of course {{{kbd(M-x helm-next-line)}}} and {{{kbd(M-x helm-previous-line)}}} are still available.

It is possible to delete candidates from the kill ring with ‘
Uses keymap ~helm-kill-ring-map~, which is not currently defined.
{{{kbd(M-x helm-kill-ring-delete)}}}’
but also persistently with ‘
Uses keymap ~helm-kill-ring-map~, which is not currently defined.
{{{kbd(M-x helm-kill-ring-run-persistent-delete)}}}’.

You can concatenate marked candidates and yank them in the current
buffer, thus creating a new entry in the kill ring.  Candidates are
concatenated with ~helm-kill-ring-separator~ as default but you can
change interactively the separator while yanking by using two prefix
args.  When you have something else than =\n= as default value for
~helm-kill-ring-separator~ and you want to use =\n= from prompt, use
{{{kbd(C-q C-j)}}} to enter a newline in prompt.

To not push a new entry in the kill ring, use {{{kbd(C-c TAB)}}} instead of RET
(note that you can’t change separator with this).

When inserting candidates with the default action ({{{kbd(RET)}}}), ~point~ is placed at
the end of the candidate and ~mark~ at the beginning.  You can revert this behavior
by using a prefix argument, i.e. {{{kbd(C-u RET)}}}, like the regular ~yank~ command does.
